### Stats, Findings, & Recommendations

1) For June and December stats, please see the final two code blocks in the climate_analysis notebook.

2) I identified the following key differences between the weather in June and December;
	
	a) The number of days where precipitation amounts were recorded in the months of June is around twice as much as the amount of precipitation amounts that were counted in December.  i.e. we have twice as much precipitation data for the months of June as we do for December.
	
	b) The number of days where tobs were recorded in the months of June is around twice as much as the amount of tobs that were counted in December.  i.e. we have twice as much tobs data for the months of June as we do for December.
	
	c) Temperatures stay relatively stable when comparing December to June.  For example, the std is very similar between tobs.
	
	d) The std between precipitation amounts in June and Dec are quite different though. I.e. the std for precipitation in December is about 22% higher than the std for for precipitation in June.

3) Recommendations

	a) Collect more data on the month of December for 2017 so that the sample sizes are more similar.
	
	b) Another additional analysis would be to look at the effects that temperature and precipitation have on products sold that are similar to ice cream.  If there were some data sets that could be found with this information in more populated areas with similar hot climates like Miami, Austin, etc, then maybe those insights could be used to figure out which months of the year on this Hawaii island would be best to sell ice cream.  Combining some sales figures by month and weather patterns could help W. Any make a better judgement call on where and when to sell ice cream.
